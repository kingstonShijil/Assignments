<h1> Day 16 </h1>

<p> We were discussing about the problem, Solution for the problem, Problem solving techniques, Problem solving tips etc... which will be helpful for real life as well as programing. Any problem is a set of constrain.

	if there is a problem it will have constrains if it doesn't have constrain it is not considered as problem. We all know problem is something which needs some additional help or thinking to solve so it is very evident that problem is build up with constrains in other words no constrain no problem.

	To identify the constrain we need some additional skills. that basically comes by experiancing all the basic problem solving technicues and tips then by writing down which is known as algorithm. 

	How we see the problem is also matters we have leared in schools if it is a cylinder it consists of rectangle and circle in 2d representation someone faced problem on cylinder so they break it down into 2D representation anf found Cylinder is the combinatin of rectangle and circle so prespective of the problem is also important.

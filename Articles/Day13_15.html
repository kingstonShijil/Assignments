<p> Algorithm: Algorithm is basically the breakdown form of problem solving. If we need to find solution for the problem as the first step we need to break down the problem. then we need to list down the constrains what we face in the problem after finding the constrain in each problem find all possible operation to form the solution. after list down the problem we have to find the best possible solution. 

	After the solution is made we have to list down the solution in step by step representation in the way even the one who does not know anything about the problem should understand. Algorithm is the step by step representation of solution. Begin with START followed by STEP BY STEP solution then Stop. This is the structure of Algorithm.

	For identifying the Solution the data we have in solution is important to understand. There are three types of DATA available in the problem. 

	<li> Not needed data also known as noise </li>
`	<li> Useful for the context or Algorithm </li>
	<li> The data which is needed for the algorithm to work </li>

	Then their is another concept called space which helps to differentiate the pattern which  is already stored in memory so uses of space between words and between line is important

<h2> What we learned from the problem </h2>

 We have seen three problems today and we supposed to write algorithm for all the threeeach have different constrain lets see what each problem teach us

<li> Problem 1 </li>

<p> Person a is planning to get chair for 25 dollars. In his account he have unlimited dollars, He also have additional 5000 rs and 5000 paise in his account. He prefered to spend maximum paise and upto 1/3 of dollars.

Constrains for this problem is

<li> Can spend upto 1/3 from dollars </li>
<li> Have to spend maximum from paise </li>
<li> 1 dollar = 17 rs </li>
<li> 1 rs = 29 paise </li>

Algorithm:

<o>

	<li> Start </li>
	<li> Convert 5000 rs to dollars i.e. 5000/17 = 294 dollars</li>
	<li> Convert 5000 paise to dollars i.e 29*17(paise to rs) = 493 rs i.e. 5000/49		    3 = 10 dollars  </li>
	<li> Store 294 dollars in account 2  </li>
	<li> Store 10 dollars in account 3  </li>
	<li> Find 1/3 amount i.e. 25 dollars/3 = 18 dollars </li>
	<li> Store 18 dollars in account 4 </li>  
	<li> Take all the 10 dollars from account 3 (Second constrain met) note: we need 	    another 15 dollars to get chair  </li>
	<li> Subtract 10 dollars from the total amount 25 we get 15 dollars  </li>
	<li> Take 15 dollars from account 2 </li>
	<li> Add 15 dollars from account 2 and 10 from account 3 and store it in accoun		    5 </li>
	<li> Use the amount from Account 5 to purchase 25 dollar chair </li>
	<li> Stop </li> 
</o>
<p>
With limited restrictive thinking we were able to build concepts of concepts. The given problem has certain limitation which is Have only arithmetic operation, logical operations and storage operations. So with this condition we can able to do only +, -, *, /, >, < The concept of loop is new and  

<h2> Problem 2 </h2>

Get best table from the shop data goes on as below

<li> Option|cost|Seating|Size </li>
<li>   1   |600 |   6   | 2.5 </li>
<li>   2   |500 |   4   | 1.5 </li>
<li>   3   |550 |   5   | 2   </li>
<li>   4   |450 |   6   | 4   </li>
<li>   5   |300 |   4   | 2   </li>
<li>   6   |550 |   5   | 2   </li> 

<h3> Solution </h3>
		
	<li> Start </li>
	<li> Filter cost by ascending order and store the table as Cost table </li>
	<li> Get the first table </li>


<h2> Problem 3 </h2>

Find the Shortest distance from the given path

<h1> Day 06 </h1>

<p> What is Computer? Computer is a machine which compute

What is compute? It simply means calclates

The overall architecture of computer goes on like this when we give the input the CPU process it and stores memory in storage device then we will get the output in Monitor.

Computer is just a mechanical device in the begining</p>

<h3> Data </h3>
	<p>Data is just a collection of information. In 300 BC Aristotil said we can have  communication in just two symbols he said as alpha and Beta. In 1700's the idea was taken then in later 1900's it was taken by electrical field and came up with concept on and off mechanism. Then this on and off concept entered into computer concept which is implemented as binary number system When we type small letter a (the binary number of a is 97 which is 01100001 binary number) stores as binary number</p>

<p> Mores code was very similar to Binary code but it is unstructured telegram uses Mores code concept which was one of the fastest way of communication in earlier days.The bit concept is inherited from switch concept which was following in Electrical field.</p>

<p> Characrer sets: Character sets are of two different types which is 
	<li> ASCII </li>
	<li> Unicode </li>

ASCII : This is the one which deals with Alphanumerial value and numbers
Unicode: This is the thing which we used as emoji

</p>
<p>
Every computer have chips every chip have microprocessor or processor eery processor have tranisistor. Every transistor is the combination of two diode. Diode is the combination of cathode and anode. We need certain amount of electrical energy to switch on the diode. Every Switching on and off was saved in memory. </p>

<p> Moors law states that for every 10 yeas the size of chip becomes twise smaller

We uses assembly using transsistors that is of four types

	<li> Aldes </li>
	<li> Multiples </li>
	<li> Flip Flop </li>
	<li> Registors </li>

OS is basically the transaction layers in assembly clock speed defines break down point when all lights are emiting 
	(ex) 1 sec = 2.4 Ghz

Quantom computer: Supports 16 states of on and off example if we spin the coin usually we calculate as heads or tails but in Quantom we have angles of rotation 16 states we have three quantom computers so far but it cant do any calculation

<h3> Number System </h3>

<p>

Unary : 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 

Roman Number: i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, vii, ix, x, xi For ever five they serve new symbol. It is the derivation of unary system.

Binary : Which is basically 1 and 0

Decimal: 0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 this is also known as indo arabic number

</p>

<p>
	When limmited operation is specified 		

		<li> Understand the operations </li>
		<li> List down the problem using the list of operation </li>

Building the concepts upon concepts is how the code is build. Limited operation computer can perform so break down the problem. When we are limited to restrictive thinking new concepts will arise. From the limited set of instruction to build something great limited restriction thinking works. Arrange list of all posible operation to solution is called algorithm.
</p>

<h3> Problem </h3>

There is a computer in which we can give input and get output in between we have processor and storage. The actual problem is we have constrains the computer know only to store and count.

Understand the problem 

Machine is stupid it does not know anything

Constrain:

<li> Store </li>
<li> Count </li>

List all possible operations: 

<li> Aggign a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5, f=6 and store it in memory </li>
<li> Convert all whole numbers into unary numbers </li>
<li> Call d from memory </li>
<li> Call f from memory </li>
<li> take the value f from the memory which is 111111 </li>
<li> take the value d from memory which is 1111 </li>
<li> count the value of d till all the 1's are met </li>
<li> store the end result in new variable z which is the output </li>


Thats the end of day

<h1> DAY 04 </h1>

<p> We have started our day by started solving of konigsberg bridge problem as the regular practice we were divided into teams to solve the problem. The problem is "If the secen bridges of the city over the river can all be traversed in a single trip without doubling back we were trying to get the solution but at one point of time we were unable to get the solution </p>

<p> Then we were able to know that every problem cannot have solution. When there is no solution we should be able to provide the definition that the problem is not solvable to explain this concept we were going through Graph theory 

	Euler drew the problem on paper with edge and vertex c(A,C), d(C,A), a(A,B), b(B,A), e(A,D), g(C,D), f(B,D) 

<h3> Vertex </h3>
	<l> A </l>
	<l> B </l>
	<l> C </l>
	<l> D </l>

<h3> Edge </h3>
	<l> a </l>
	<l> b </l>
	<l> c </l>
	<l> d </l>
	<l> e </l>
	<l> f </l>
	<l> g </l>

After drew the map on paper Euler came to conclution Every vertex can be connected only if we have two edges connected to every vertex. </p>

<h3> What we learn fron this example </h3>

	<l> From this mathametical solution new theory arises called Graph theory </l>
	<l> Most of the mutual friend concept uses Eulers graph theory </l>
	<l> We can get solutions from mathametics </l>

<p> We have learned another tips to our existing problem solving tips "Synthesis it back together" </p>

Our existing problem solvin tips:

	<l> Less constrain more Choice, More choices less limitation </l>
	<l> Breakdown the problem into pieces </l>
	<l> Do Trial and error method to find the solution </l>
	<l> Some problems need strategy to solve </l>
	<l> Synthesis back to the problem </l>

All the above tips are not applicable for all the problems. When the problem become harder we need mathemetic thinking to break the problem That is what we learnt from Euler Graph theory.

<h3> Puzzle DecaHedron </h3>

All the vertex of Decahedron should be touched once 

Before discussing with team I solved the problem in mind as soon as vertex were available on board. Then we gathered as team to solve the problem we started our regular problem solving techniques 

<l> Understand the Problem </l>
	 <p>All the vertex in the Decahedron shoould be touched once </p>
<l> List the constrains </l>
	<ul> All the edge should be connect to vertex only once </ul>
	<ul> Edge should not travel twice to connect to vertex </ul>
	<ul> Time constrain to complete the problem is 10 min </ul>

<l> List all possible operations </l>
	<p> We all started with different vertex to connect to other vertex using edges. All can able to achieve the solution with different possibilities</p>

<l> Arrange operation to form the solution </l>
	<p> We can able to get the solution in all different methods. If we start from top or bottom, right or left, center we were able to get the solutions </p>

<p> From this we came to learn some new concept called Hamiltonian path(this is the graph path that visit each vertex exactly once). There might be problem which has Hamiltonian solution. <p>

Other things we need to remember when we have problem

<l> Problem Have Solution or Not which we learned from Euler graph theory </l>
<l> Given Solution is correct or not from Hamiltonian path </l>
<l> Trial and Error Method from Chess </l>

 We have also learned two other things from hamiltonian path

<l> Dont break the problem in wrong way </l>
<l> Synthesis the problem should also match the pattern of the problem(Must remember How to put all the solution together) </l>

example: Cube

<p>Cube comes under Hamiltonian path. But if we break the cube in the wrong pieces it may not be hamiltonian. So we should be very carefull when we break the problem. The problem might not get the expected solution if we break down it in the wrong way. </p>  

<h3> MENTAL MODELS </h3>

This is the model which we already seen or find solution earlier like

<l> Knight in Chess - Follows Hamiltonian path </l>
<l> Cube - Follows Hamiltonian path </l>
<l> Chess - Trial and error method </l>

<h3> General Tip </h3>

 <p> When you are reaching the frustation level in any work you are doing please stop the work then and there and move it to other task/ work so than we can avoid frustation. When we reach the frustation point our focus will be Tunnel vision whis is not advisible to follow because we will not get any solution from the frustation point.</p>

<p> What is Mark up language? 
	Adds additional context and formating to the existing language is called Mark up. There are different types of Mark up which is already in the planet like JSON, YAML, HTML, XML etc..

It consists of 
	<l> Formation <l>
	<l> Context/ Tables </l>
	<l> Headings </l>
	<l> Emphasis </l>
		<ul> Bold </ul>
		<ul> Italics </ul>
		<ul> Underline </ul>
		<ul> Strikeout </ul>
	<l> Lists </l>
		<ul> Organised list </ul>
		<ul> Unorganised list </ul>
	<l> Quotes </l>
 
After knowing this we were asked us to write our own mark up language. We formed our group to write our own mark up language 

As a regular practice we were going through the proplem
<l> Understanding the problem </l>
	Write your own markup language
<l> list down the constrains </l>
	No limitations
<l> list all possible operations </l>
	This problem follows hamiltonian path so there is no one solution
<l> Gather operation to form the solution </l> 
	<o>
		<l> <king> - Heading </l>
		<l> <ston> - Bold </l>
		<l> <win> - Italics </l>
		<l> <all> - Underline </l>
		<l> <Ash> - Strikeout </l>
		<l> <kalz> - Organised list </l>
		<l> <yan> - Unorganized list </l> 
	</o>

There is no right or wrong in the solution because it follows hamiltonian path

When we were reproducing the answer one amoung our team come up with idea of grouping the tags. Then new question arise does grouping tags will be helpfull in a single document. The conversation goes on then i come to the conclusion grouping tags does not helpful in single document.<p>

Thats the end of the day...

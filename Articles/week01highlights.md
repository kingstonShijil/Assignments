Lets recollect what we learnt this week

##Day 01

Software engineer sould have some basic skills 
	- Reading
	- Writing
	- Problem solving
	- Mathematical thinking
	- Researching
	- Break down and synthesis the problem
	- Typing
	- Creativity

According to dreyfus - dreyfus model of learning Novice should have to follow all the rules blindly, Advanced beginer should have to follow rules but conditionaly, Expert have choice to follow rules. 

We have learned basic commmands in git like ls, cd, cp, sudo, vi, mkdir, esc, i, v, w, u, ctrl+v, y, p, dd, $, G, gg.

We have learned basic Markup language comments like #, *, -, Para, List

##DAY 02

We have learned problem solving techniques 

	- Understand the problem. Dont avoid the problem
	- Identify the constrains
	- List all possible operations that dont violate the constrains
	- Arrange operaton to form a solution.

Tips of problem solving

	- Less constrain more choice, More Choice less constrain
	- Trial and Error method
	- Break down the problem example Sudoko
	- Some problem need *Strategy* to solve.

##Day 03

We learnt about language, communication, vocablary

* Language - Communication tool to represent the idea
* Communication - Education enables us to communicate
* Vocablary - Helps the communication easier (ex) Bike.

When we conclude Solution as solution?

- When the problem is solved
- All constrains were met
- Solution is formalised (Reproduce the solution to different problem).

We have learned another tip of problem solving 

	- Look for Anology 

There are three clases of Problems

1. Scalability Problem
2. Resource constrain Problem
3. Domain Problem

##Day 04

We learned another tip for problem solving 

	- Synthesis the solution together
		* Break down the problem
		* Dont break it in wrong way

Additional tip: We need Mathematical thinking to breakdown the harder problem

We learned about Mental Model which we see in the world earlier

	- Knight in Chess board follows Hamiltonian path
	- Cube follows Hamiltonian path
	- Chess engine follows trial and error method

Definition of mark up language: Adds additional context and formating to the existing language. Some of the existing Mark up languages are Json, YMAL, HTML, XML etc...

##Day 05

We were brainstroming about Hamiltonian path and Euler graph theory. Then we discussed about the Do's and Dont's of premeeting, Meeting and Post meeting.

#Day 02:

##Introduction

After the successfull Day 01 we moved to Day 02. I have started my day with the same exitment which i had on day 1 that does not disappointed me we have learnead a lot more than day 1. I have failed to complete the 1000 word assignment at day 2 because i have failed to prioritize time and the amount of work i have to complete for the day. No problem in it Failing is also a part of the Equation. I have failed to completele 1000 words assignment and i suffered to sleep because of incomplete work. Okay lets summerise what we learned on DAY 02.

##Day 02 Summary

We have started our day with problem solving. Questin was asked by the HOST "There was Black Smoke coming out of the Car What was the solution for that" People were discussing amoung themselves and came up with different points like
 
* Call a mechanic
* Call a friend who knows more about CAR
* Check Engine Oil
* Check Battery
* Google it
* Sell a car and get the new one 
* Switch of the car

After hearing all the possible options from the folks HOST started discussing aboutProblem solving what is problem what is the solution for the problem like wise it went on Problem solving goes like this

- Understand the Problem and dont avoid the problem
- Identify the constrains
- Validate all possible operations that dont violate the constrains
- Arrange operation to form a solution

To explain these steps we have given the puzzle to solve. The puzzle was There is a man, Fox, Goose and corn staying in one side of the river they have to move to next side of the river All they have is one Boat. In that Boat only 2 can travel at a time. We were divided into teams to solve this puzzle.

Kingston paired with Winall to solve the puzzle we have cracked the puzzle with 7 trips as total. After the solution were made we stick to the core of problem solvingpoints we discussed about it.

Then we were given another Puzzle to explain about the problem solving points which we discussed earlier The puzzle goes on like this We have 1-35 numbers using this we have to enter some of next two consiqutive number should be perfect square. We were again divided into teams this time *KINGSTON*, *ASWIN*, *WINALL*, *KALYAN* werepaired then we begin to solve the problem.

We have statred to decode our problem in the way we have learned little earlier.
1. Understand the Problem
	- The Sum of consicutive number should be perfect Square number
	- The number we should be 1-35
2. Identify the constrains 
	- Use number only 1-35
	- Number should not be repeated
	- Consiqutive number should be perfect square number
	- Complete the problem within 1 hour.
3. List all the possible operation
	- Ascending order
	- Descending order
4. Arrange operation to form a solution
 Ascending order - Applying least possible outcome we were able to achieve all the perfect square within 16 steps but we failed to have all 35 numbers

 Descending Order - We have failed to achieve in Ascending order so we have moved to another solution usis his method we were able to achive the desired outcome.

After all the team were completed with the Puzzle we were brainstroming about the solution all other team came uo with. Then HOST gave us HW based on the outcome of all the results 

*HOME WORK* - End DATE: 7/6/2021
	- Why Ascending is Hard solution?
	- Which approach is most efficient?
	- Can we able to solve all other problems with the same solution for ex i we were given numbers 1-42 to sort out  

Then we moved to sudoko puzzle to learn solution from POLIA - HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM from this puzzle we learnt
	- When we have Less constrain we get more choice, When there is More constrain we get less choice
	- Trial and error Method(Find the solution to the problem)
	- Break down the problem

Then we moved to number puzzle to learn other methors of solving problem. The solution to the problem was 
	- Identify the Train
	- Move the train clockwise and anticlock wise 

##Techinical Session

###GIT

We have learned some basic comments about git it goes on as follows

- Sign up to git using link www.github.com/signup
- Create a new repositary named as Assignments
- Enter Repositary name as Assignments and click the public key button then click on create new repositary button
- Create Repositary named as Assignments on CENT OS Terminal
- In the terminal use 
	* git init - To initialize the git repo
	* git remote add origin "git link" - to set the remote link of the GIT on outr Local Machine
	* If we get any mistakes we need to do the below steps
		- git config -- global user.name "User NAME"
		- git config --global user.email "User Email"
	* Do git pull

Using this comments Create a new folder in local machine name it as Articles. Under articles create new md file for the day. Write a 1000 word essay in those file and upload the outcome in the Assignments Repositary in git.

Using
- git add "file name" to add the file in the git
- git commit -m "message" - To write the message for every commit
- git push origin -M main - To push the written file to our git repositary

In the mean time we have installed git GUI

#Conclusion
	- Understand the problem
	- Identify the constrains
	- List all the possible operation that dont violate constrains
	- Arrange constrains to form a solution
	- Less limitation more choice, More choice less limitation
	- Trial and error to get the soltion
	- Break down the problem 
	- Get strategy for the problem

Thats how our day has ended

##Introduction

We have started our session  with an Example which explains about "Understand the Concept" to demonstrate this HOST has given the word "RED" and asked to think what is the first thing which comes to mind when you hear RED. People Written many things, then we started discussing about what every one written on their note when they hear the word RED. The purpose of this workout is basically understand the "Concept"

For example lets take BIKE

BIKE - 2 wheels, 2 mirror, engine, connecting wires, screws and nuts which connects the parts of the vehicle.

If some one askes us how you came here we will say "Came by bike" not "Came by the iron piece which has two wheels, two mirrors, engine etc."

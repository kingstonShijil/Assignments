#Day3

##Introduction

We have started our session  with an Example which explains about "Understand the Concept" to demonstrate this HOST has given the word "RED" and asked to think what is the first thing which comes to mind when you hear RED. People Written many things, then we started discussing about what every one written on their note when they hear the word RED. The purpose of this workout is basically understand the "Concept"

For example lets take BIKE

BIKE - 2 wheels, 2 mirror, engine, connecting wires, screws and nuts which connects the parts of the vehicle.

If some one askes us how you came here we will say "Came by bike" not "Came by the iron piece which has two wheels, two mirrors, engine etc."  

Then we have given the word "Current"and asked us to write it down on paper we have written it down then we were asked us to explain what we have writtenon paper. Eveybody tell what they have written when my turn came i said"When i hear the word Current Transformer is coming through my mind" what we have learned from this is "Current" is the word which explains the concept flow of electron and measured in amp. Education is basically the understanding the concept.

Maths is a language to explain this concept there was a example given "I have 2 pens on my left hand and 2 pens on my right hand" How many pens i have here the concept "Addition arises" What Basically Language does is Represent idea and representation of Idea

It can follow 2 paths

flow 1

* Ideas
* Abstraction
* Operation

Flow 2

* Idea 
* Representation of idea
* Operations

Education enable us to communicate what we learn from langauage is idea and representation of idea for example we can say Bike What basically bike is Representstion of Idea. Adding more words to the vocablary makes language beautiful learn more vocablay and terms what we used in company.

(ex) Bike is a word which abstracts the idea of 2 mirrors, two wheeles, engine, connecting wires, Battery, connecting wires and connecting metal pieces. the more we know the terms and vocablary the communication becomes beautiful.

If we take Square. Sq is just the shape but it represents the mathametical idea side, perimeter, area and angles

What defines a solution?

- Problem is solved
- All constrains were met
- Solutiion is formalized (Reproduce solution multiple times)

We were given Quracy lock problem to solve

We were divided into teams to solve the problem as discussed earlier we have splited the problem

* Understand the problem
	- For every even star pattern light will glow
	- For every odd star patten light will not glow
	- If there is only one light glew alam will blow

* Constrains
	- Solve the problem within 10 min time
	- 1st bar and the 2nd bar cannot be on same side
	- 2nd bar and 3rd bar cannot be on the same side
	- 1st bar and 3rd bar can be on same side

* List all possible solutions:

	- Move 2nd bar to the left reciptor
	- While coming back return empty
	- Move 1st bar to left reciptor
	- Move 2nd bar to right reciptor
	- Move 3rd bar to left reciptor
	- While coming back return empty
	- Move 2nd bar to the left reciptor

* Arrange operatins to form the solution

	When we do these steps we will get the solution

What we learn from this problem is Look for Analogy( A comparison between two things that shows a way in which they are smilar. Not all the problems are same at the same time some might have similar solution.

There are 3 different classes of problem

a. Scalability problem (This basically deals with number of users)
b. Resource constrain problem (Which comes under Emberded system ex fridge)
c. Domain problem (Payments, Retail)


Thats the end of day 3

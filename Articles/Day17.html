<h1> Day 17 </h1>

<p> We were discussing about the problem solving and its techniques so far we are addin one more thing to it the concept called compiler or translator. This is the thing which is used to filter and compare the given input in the computer. Human brain do the same but we were not aware of this process. Human brain gets every word what it gets as input then process it weather it as proper sentence which already registered in memory. Compiler does the same.

	Compiler consists of 4 different layers each have its own comparison/Translation algorithm which filters the input and give user the output. 	
	<li> Tokeniser and lexical parsing </li>
	<li> Syntactic Analyse </li>
	<li> Sematic Analysis </li>
	<li> Code Generator </li>

Tokeniser and Lexical parsing break down the block to token and validate weather the token have meaning in it 

Syntatic Anayles is the next layer of the compailer which actually deals with the structure of the words ex kingston is playing compiler compare each words "kingston" "is" "playing" and validates the meaning of it. 

Sematic Analysis is the next layer of the compiler which checks the whole sentence and validate weather the given sentence make any sence for example "Kingston is hjjhhd". copiler will.

So basically these are the algorithms which already predesigned the engineersw
